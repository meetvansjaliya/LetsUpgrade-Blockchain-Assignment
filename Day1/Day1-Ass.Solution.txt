1.What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Ans: It is a concept derived by mix technology to ensures data is not changed or tampered and is verifiable at any given instance.It is a combination of cryptography and distributed database where data is segmented in blocks which are stored in multiple machines.It is one-way encryption & for every data it generates a unique hash.



2.What is the core problem Blockchain is trying to solve?
Ans:The core problem Blockchain trying to solve are:
        1. Security 
        2. Authenticity 
        3.Reliability 
        Blockchain addresses the problem of data security and trust by making the ledger public,the problem of data loss due to hardware or connectivity issues and the problem of data corruption due to intermittent hardwareor connectivity issues, etc.



3.What are the few features which Blockchainwill give you?
Ans:Features-
            -> Verifiable
            -> Immutable
            -> Tamper-proof
            -> Unchangeable
            -> Decentralized
            -> Faster settlement
            -> Distributed ledgers

4.What all things does a Block contain?
Ans: Block contains-
                    -> Block number.
                    -> Transaction records.
                    -> Previous block signature.
                    -> Mining key.

5.How is verifiability of Blockchain has been attained?
Ans: Verifiability of Blockchain is achieved with the help of distributed database system. In this system every user has a same record of all the transactions taken. In this process all the users have the same data with similar hash at the end. Hash is simply a fingerprint(code/key) which is used to check whether everyone has the correct chronological order of the data.
Block 1 = A+B = C
Block 2 = B+D = F
Where,
A is Genesis Block,
B&D are data to be stored.
